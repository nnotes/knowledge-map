*** Definitions



** Init State

   - NNotes has no way to give learners an estimate of their degree of mastery
     of their knowledge.



** Problem

   - Minimizing learning time is both an expectation from learers/authors and a
     claim of NNotes.  NNotes cannot avoid this one!



** End State

   - NNotes offers a knowledge map that let users visualize their degree of
     mastery of knowledge and rank them.
